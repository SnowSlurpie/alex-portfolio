# My Portfolio

This is a portfolio I have created to showcase projects and assignments that I create. This has been formatted with desktop and mobile viewing in mind. This will be continually updated as I progress through my schooling. 

This project will primarily utilize HTML and CSS.

Working links are included in this project to review my work as well as contact me. Please feel free to contact me at the included email if you have any business inqueries! 

Thank you for taking the time to review my README.
